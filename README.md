## Dependencies

 - Node.js (v10.0.0 or later)
 - Docker CE

## Getting started
### Project set up
Run the following commands in the console:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/unicsmcr/hs_application.git
$ cd hs_application
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Finally, replace placeholders in .env for your own project

## Deployment with Docker
The fastest way of getting the project up and running is to use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file. Make sure you have [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed on your system.
### Starting the app
First, complete the initial set up (above). Then run one of the 2 commands in a terminal:

```bash
$ make up
```
or
```bash
$ make up-dev
# This will start the app with live reloading

# NOTE: you will need to restart the application whenever you install a new package or change the environment variables in the .env file
```
The first command will create two containers:
* NodeJS Applications Platform
* MySQL database

It also creates two Docker networks:
* `internal_hackathon`
* `hacker_suite`

The first time you run the command, it will take a while since it will install the required services. Next time you run the command, it will be much faster since dependencies are cached.

The NodeJS app will be available at `localhost:8010` or as `hs_application` on the `hacker_suite` network. The MySQL database will be available at `localhost:8011`, you can connect using the MySQL GUI tool of your choice 

`internal_hackathon` is a network used by hs_application containers internally to communicate with each other, while `hacker_suite` is used to connect all consumer-facing Hacker Suite services.

### Logging
The output from the apps can be attached to the terminal with one of the following commands:
```bash
$ make logs // will attach the logs from all 3 containers
$ make logs-app // will attach the logs from the NodeJS app
$ make logs-db // will attach the logs from the database
```

### Stopping the app
The app can be stopped with:
```
$ make down
```

## Running the tests
Assuming you have completed the intial set up, you can run the test suite using the either of the following command:
```
$ make tests
```
